# Struct2Prefs
This is an example for the Arduino <a href="https://github.com/vshymanskyy/Preferences" target="_new">Preferences library</a>, showing how to store and read back a struct with various data types.

The Preferences library lacks documentation. 
It's easy to figure it out by looking at the header file, but the two examples it includes don't show how to use different keys.
Also it doesn't show how to save structs with various data types, a common situation when dealing with settings, so I wanted to share one way of going about it.
